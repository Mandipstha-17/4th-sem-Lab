# Theory of Computation Lab Programs


---

## 📁 LAB 1 – Foundation
- WAP to find **prefix**, **suffix**, and **substring** of an entered string.

---

## 📁 LAB 2 – Implementation of DFA
1. WAP to implement DFA over {0,1} that accepts all strings **starting with `01`**  
2. WAP to implement DFA over {0,1} that accepts all strings **ending with `01`**  
3. WAP to implement DFA over {0,1} that accepts all strings **containing `01`** as a substring  

---

## 📁 LAB 3 – Implementation of NFA
1. WAP to implement NFA over {0,1} that accepts all strings **starting with `10`**  
2. WAP to implement NFA over {0,1} that accepts all strings **ending with `01`**  
3. WAP to implement NFA over {0,1} that accepts all strings **containing `101`** as a substring  

---

## 📁 LAB 4 – Additional NFA Programs
1. WAP to check if an input string is a **valid identifier or keyword** in the C programming language  
2. Implement NFA to **accept your first name**  
3. Implement NFA to **accept "Prime College"**  

---

## 📁 LAB 5 – Implementation of Regular Expression
1. WAP to **validate email address** using regular expressions  
2. WAP to **validate whether a number is prime or not**

---

## 📁 LAB 6 – Regular Expression to FA Conversion
1. Convert `0*(1+0)001` to FA  
2. Convert `a(a+b)*b` to FA  

---

## 📁 LAB 7 – PDA for Language
1. WAP to design PDA for language: `aⁿbⁿcⁿ`, where n ≥ 1  
2. WAP to design PDA for language: `wcwⁿ`, where w ∈ (0+1)+  

---

## 📁 LAB 8 – Implementation of Turing Machine (TM)
1. Design TM for computing function `f(x) = x + 1`  
2. Design TM to generate the **2's complement** of an entered binary number
